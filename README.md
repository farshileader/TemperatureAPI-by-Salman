🌤️ My First Real-Time Weather Website Project! 🌤️

I'm thrilled to share a milestone in my journey as a developer: the completion of my first real-time weather website project using React.js and a weather API! 🚀

This project has been an incredible learning experience from start to finish. Building the website from scratch allowed me to deepen my understanding of React.js and gain hands-on experience with API integration.

While the website isn't deployed yet, I'm proud of the progress I've made and excited about the possibilities it holds. Soon, users will be able to access real-time weather updates with just a few clicks, thanks to this project.

Stay tuned for updates as I work towards deploying the website and making it accessible to everyone. I can't wait to share the final product with you all!
